# extract-handwritten-data-aws
AWS Textract is a machine learning tool that extracts data from scanned documents. Among the documents generated by Textract we can find a JSON file containing information (coordinates in the file, text, accuracy â€¦) about the data contained in the input document fed to Textract. The tool I have developed performs further analysis on this data.
